## Overview of the statistical analysis

The purpose of the following analysis is to better understand weather patterning on Oahu in the months of June and December. This information will be indispensable as we decide whether or not it is a viable business plan to open our surf shop on the island.

## Results

Below are the two deliverables that give summary data for the June temperatures and the December temperatures:

Comparing this summary data, fairly immediately a few important differences become apparent:

* The average (mean) temperature for December is almost four degrees lower than the average (mean) temperature for June; this approximately four-degree difference is also borne out in the median temperatures for June and December.
* The minimum temperature is *significantly* lower in December, at 56 degrees compared to June's 64 degrees. As one might expect, the maximum temperature in December is also lower, albeit less dramatically so (83 degrees to June's 85).
* The standard deviation of the temperatures is approximately half a degree higher in the December data versus the June data, indicating that the temperatures in December are less consistent overall than the June temperatures.

## Summary

The data gives us some important information about the year-long sustainability of our surf shop. While the data for June is very promising, there will be challenges associated with the increased variability in December's data, as well as the fact that it is lower on average than in June. More information that would be helpful in getting a fuller picture of weather patterning in these two months would be the precipitation data. To that end, we could modify our queries from the Challenge code to record precipitation data for each of those months, as follows:
